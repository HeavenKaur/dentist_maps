# Google Maps Business Scraper

This project is a web scraper that extracts business details from Google Maps and saves the data into a MySQL database. It uses Selenium for web scraping and MySQL Connector for database operations.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, you need to have the following installed on your machine:

- Python 3.x
- Google Chrome browser
- ChromeDriver
- MySQL database

### Python Libraries

You can install the required Python libraries using the following command:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Requirements

Create a requirements.txt file with the following content:

selenium==4.8.0
mysql-connector-python==8.0.31

##Usage

1. Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/HeavenKaur/dentist_maps.git
cd dentist_maps

2. Set Up MySQL Database:

Create a MySQL database named business_data.
Create a table named businesses with the following schema:
CREATE TABLE businesses (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    business_name VARCHAR(255),
    address TEXT,
    category VARCHAR(255),
    review_average VARCHAR(50),
    review_count VARCHAR(50),
    website VARCHAR(255),
    phone_number VARCHAR(50)
);

3. Update Database Credentials:

Update the MySQL database connection details in the script:

conn = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="your_host",
    user="your_username",
    password="your_password",
    database="business_data"
)

4. Run the Script:

Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
Run the script:
python main.py

### Script Details
The script performs the following steps:

1. Initialize Selenium WebDriver: Opens Google Chrome and navigates to Google Maps with a search query for dentists near a specified location.
2. Scroll Through Results: Continuously scrolls through the search results to load more businesses.
3. Extract Business Details: For each business, extracts details such as name, address, category, review average, review count, website, and phone number.
4. Save Data to MySQL: Inserts the extracted data into the businesses table in the MySQL database.

##Challenges

1. Handling Dynamic Web Content: Google Maps is a dynamic web application that loads content asynchronously. Use Selenium's explicit waits to ensure elements are fully loaded before interacting with them.
2. Database Connection Management: Ensuring the database connection is stable and handling potential connection errors. Implement proper error handling and connection management to handle dropped connections gracefully.
3. Performance Optimization: The scraping process can be slow, especially with large datasets. Optimize the scraping logic, minimize the number of requests, and use efficient data structures.
4. Legal and Ethical Considerations: Scraping data from websites can sometimes be against the site's terms of service. Ensure you comply with the website's terms of service and consider the ethical implications of your scraping activities.
